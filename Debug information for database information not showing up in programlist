Debugging progress

-Removed: class="programInfo" in tbody tag at around line 226
-Result: 3 empty rows appeared

-Added: log helper for td this.programitem calls.
-Result: printed out actual value of variables that matched the database entries.

-Removed: "this." tags in the table cells
-Result: nothing changed, however log still prints actual values "this." tag might not be needed

-Removed: log handlebars helper
-Result: fixed bug

Tried and no changes
Removed all of the script portion in: "program-list.hbs"
Removed jquery script at around line 251
Added class to add custom css to program details.

Additional notes
Exported to csv and was empty suggesting that values were not properly passed
Inspecting elements also shows the td tags being empty
Something might be wrong with how we are passing the values

PROBABLE SOLUTION:
class="programInfo" was probably the thing linking the javascript at the top which was allowing us to use the create form and diverted access away from the actual server connection

Log function probably just diverted values to print into the console and it was actually working
